      <h2>Is cardio good for bulking up?</h2>
      <p>

      <p>
        What is the best cardio for building muscle? Long bouts of steady state
        cardio have been proven to increase cortisol levels and break down
        muscle. Instead, opt for exercises such as high intensity interval
        training, walking lunges, sled drags/pushes/pulls, loaded carries,
        sprints that build muscle while burning fat. I personally believe that
        one should include cardio in their workout. I recommend twice a week
        cardio.It has a massive impact on your overall health and muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, cardio does not necessarily help to build muscle in the way
        that strength training does. However, a well-rounded routine will help
        you get to your goals faster. Remember to include ample rest days so
        that your muscle has time to build—after all—muscle is built on rest
        days.

      <h2>Why should men do yoga? benefits</h2>
      <p>

      <p>
        I get it, Yoga might not be the most intense workout—at least, most
        forms of it aren’t—and it probably isn’t the first thing that pops in
        your mind when thinking of a fitness class you want to try. But yoga can
        help you so many different things,
      </p>
      <p>
        It also enhances body flexibility, supports physical readiness for other
        exercises, and improves sexual performance. Men have certain muscles
        that are the main targets of exercises at the gym, such as hamstrings,
        glutes, abdomen and shoulders. But yoga helps the body to perform well.

      <h2>Healthy foods to gain muscle mass ?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Author:</strong> Jaabir Esau <strong>Published:</strong> 24 July

      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img
          src="https://www.trifectanutrition.com/hubfs/weight-gain-foods-list-heres-the-top-75-foods-to-eat-to-gain-muscle-1-1.png"

      </div>
      <p>
        You want to pack on muscle mass. But, you want to focus on quality foods
        rather than eating everything in sight, which may ultimately be
        detrimental to your long-term health. As a hard gainer myself who has
        struggled to put on weight. Eating almost anything is definetly not a
        good plan. Cholesterol levels increasing due to the unhealthy fat and
        sugar dumped into the most common calorically dense food, I had to
        discover the healthiest bulking foods for hard gainers. Here are 16 main
        foods you should include in your diet. Eggs, Nuts, seeds Beef, Beans,
        Yogurt, Milk, Cheese, Oil, Avocado, Olives, Dried Fruit, Whole Grain
        Bread, Crackers, Pasta, Potatoes, Oats and Granola.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you take drastic measures to shift your weight too quickly, it can
        result in unhealthy side effects and damage your metabolism, especially
        if you’ve struggled with disordered eating in the past, are taking
        certain medications, or have a medical condition. Make sure to check in
        with your doctor before making any changes to your diet or fitness plan.

      <h2>Why calisthenics ?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Author:</strong> Jaabir Esau <strong>Published:</strong> 25 July
        2020
      </p>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img
          src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b197f3364126ba19c351adf67621e66f"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        I believe that calisthenics is a create way to build muscle. If you're
        already physically fit and want to increase muscle strength, you can
        adjust calisthenic exercises for your fitness level. For example, you
        can add extra weight while you exercise. This could mean wearing a
        weighted belt to do pull-ups. You can also make exercises harder by
        changing your body position. Try raising your legs on a platform or a
        step while you do push-ups. This challenges your muscles more, which
        helps build strength. Building muscle may give you a leaner appearance,
        too. Calisthenics may also help make your body more flexible. They can
        also be good for helping you stick to workouts for a longer time. But in
        order to get the full benefit, you have to do the exercises quickly. You
        can't stop for more than a minute or so between each set. That keeps
        your heart rate up, making calisthenics a more challenging and effective
        workout.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of calisthenics depend on your fitness level. For beginners
        who are only able to do 10-12 repetitions at a time, the workout helps
        build muscle strength. Once you're able to do more reps, calisthenics
        help increase muscle endurance -- how long you can keep up the exercise.
