      <h2>Is cardio good for bulking up?</h2>

      <p>
        What is the best cardio for building muscle? Long bouts of steady state
        cardio have been proven to increase cortisol levels and break down
        muscle. Instead, opt for exercises such as high intensity interval
        training, walking lunges, sled drags/pushes/pulls, loaded carries,
        sprints that build muscle while burning fat. I personally believe that
        one should include cardio in their workout. I recommend twice a week
        cardio.It has a massive impact on your overall health and muscles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, cardio does not necessarily help to build muscle in the way
        that strength training does. However, a well-rounded routine will help
        you get to your goals faster. Remember to include ample rest days so
        that your muscle has time to build—after all—muscle is built on rest
        days.

      <h2>Healthy foods to gain muscle mass ?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Author:</strong> Bill Clinton,
        <strong>Published:</strong> Yesterday
      </p>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img
          src="https://themusclebook.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/spinning-bike-cardio.png"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        You want to pack on muscle mass. But, you want to focus on quality foods
        rather than eating everything in sight, which may ultimately be
        detrimental to your long-term health. As a hard gainer myself who has
        struggled to put on weight. Eating almost anything is definetly not a
        good plan. Cholesterol levels increasing due to the unhealthy fat and
        sugar dumped into the most common calorically dense food, I had to
        discover the healthiest bulking foods for hard gainers. Here are 16 main
        foods you should include in your diet. Eggs, Nuts, seeds Beef, Beans,
        Yogurt, Milk, Cheese, Oil, Avocado, Olives, Dried Fruit, Whole Grain
        Bread, Crackers, Pasta, Potatoes, Oats and Granola.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you take drastic measures to shift your weight too quickly, it can
        result in unhealthy side effects and damage your metabolism, especially
        if you’ve struggled with disordered eating in the past, are taking
        certain medications, or have a medical condition. Make sure to check in
        with your doctor before making any changes to your diet or fitness plan.
