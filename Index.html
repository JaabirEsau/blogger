                <p>
                  A few days before my 1st surgery, I was on the
                  bodybuilding.com website and I stumbled across the newest IFBB
                  bodybuilding category, Men’s Physique. I had been training
                  consistently for 6 years at that time so wanted to use what I
                  had devoted my life to building and see if I could make a
                  career out of what I loved. One month later I competed and won
                  the overall title at my first show. Exactly a year after my
                  first competition I went on to win Nationals, which made me
                  the youngest IFBB Professional in history! Two months after
                  becoming an IFBB Pro I won my first Pro show that qualified me
                  to step on stage at the first ever Mr. Olympia Men’s Physique
                  Showdown. After the Mr. Olympia contest my career really took
                  off. I was now flying around the world for various expos and
                  appearances monthly. I see my new life as a way to motivate
                  others to never forget about their dreams and always stay
                  hungry for more. Most recently, I competed in the Mr. Olympia
                  a second time and started my own clothing company, SeidWear.
                  Just recently I wrote a book, Guide to Aesthetics. It’s over
                  150 pages of everything I’ve learned so far in my journey to
                  aesthetics. You can check out the book on this website and
                  read more about it if you want. Running my own businesses has
                  been a blast – the competitions, the YouTube videos, ISSA
                  certified online personal training, and now clothing/books.
                  I’ve always said it’s one thing to be sponsored, then a whole
                  other ball game to own a company. Everything is going
                  according to plan, but still my hunger for more thrives. I’m
                  just getting started. What I’ve learned from my journey this
                  far is that strength does not come from winning. Your
                  struggles develop your strength. When you go through hardships
                  and decide not to give up, that is strength. – Jeff Seid

                  One of the biggest questions in the fitness industry is:
                  Should I do cardio? The answer: Yes. Although you can get a
                  ripped body without doing any cardio, doing it will only help
                  you achieve that body you want much faster. It will also
                  increment your ability to go longer in your strength workouts
                  which will make you stronger and more muscular in the long
                  run. Unless you want to put 10+ pounds of muscle in the
                  fastest amount then you should be doing cardio at least once a
                  week. Now, you may be wondering: What is the best type of
                  cardio? There are many forms of cardio, however, most of them
                  fall into two categories: Steady pace cardio or High intensity
                  cardio (As well as HIIT). Even though your body will use only
                  fat as energy when doing steady pace cardio while HIIT will
                  use more of your glycogen storages, doing high intensity
                  cardio has been shown to burn more overall calories and leave
                  your body with a ”After Burn” effect for about 48h. In short,
                  HIIT cardio has been shown to be more effective for fat loss
                  than regular steady pace cardio. So, what exactly is HIIT? It
                  stand for High intensity interval training. The execution
                  consist on getting your heart rate as high as possible for a
                  period of time, then completely rest for a shorter period of
                  time and repeat the cycle. Finally, a great addition to this
                  would be performing exercises that also work your strength
                  and/or power. In the following video you will be able to see a
                  great example of a Killer HIIT workout that will leave you
                  tired (But burning fat) for days! Enjoy 😉

                  CrossFit Endurance is essentially a combination of
                  circuit-based workouts where you lift heavy, often as fast as
                  possible. They’re called “AMRAP” (As Many Reps As Possible)
                  workouts and are based on time.These workouts are incredibly
                  intense. They’re then combined with HIIT (high-intensity
                  interval training), also known as Tabata Sprints.The
                  high-intensity, multi-joint movements in CrossFit may help you
                  gain muscle strength and stamina. Adding additional weight to
                  your workouts can further increase muscle gain by adding
                  stress to your muscles.CrossFit workouts often include
                  functional exercises, or exercises that mimic movements you do
                  in everyday life. Functional movements, such as squats,
                  kettlebell swings, or overhead presses, can help improve
                  agility, balance, and flexibility.
